SELECT w.workorder_id, w.vin, w.start_date, w.end_date, w.workorder_status, p.payment_status
FROM ad_workorders w
LEFT JOIN ad_payments p ON w.workorder_id = p.workorder_id
WHERE w.workorder_status = 'COMPLETED';

--2. Find all work orders that are still in progress:
SELECT workorder_id, vin, start_date, end_date, schedule_id, workorder_status
FROM ad_workorders
WHERE workorder_status = 'IN PROGRESS';

--3. Count the number of work orders for each vehicle:
SELECT vin, COUNT(*) AS num_workorders
FROM ad_workorders
GROUP BY vin;

--4. Find the latest payment date for each work order:
SELECT workorder_id, MAX(payment_date) AS latest_payment_date
FROM ad_payments
GROUP BY workorder_id;

--5. Get the total number of completed and pending work orders:
SELECT workorder_status, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM ad_workorders
GROUP BY workorder_status;

--6. List all vehicles that have at least one pending work order:
SELECT DISTINCT w.vin
FROM ad_workorders w
WHERE w.workorder_status = 'PENDING';

--7. Find the average duration of completed work orders:
SELECT AVG(end_date - start_date) AS avg_duration
FROM ad_workorders
WHERE workorder_status = 'COMPLETED';

--8. Get the payment status and amount (if available) for each work order:
SELECT w.workorder_id, COALESCE(p.payment_status, 'NOT PAID') AS payment_status
FROM ad_workorders w
LEFT JOIN ad_payments p ON w.workorder_id = p.workorder_id;

--9. Retrieve the list of all work orders that started and ended in the same month:
SELECT workorder_id, vin, start_date, end_date
FROM ad_workorders
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM end_date)
AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM end_date);

--10. Show the total number of payments for each payment status:
